        <p>
          Over the course of human history, science has developed from our early
          understanding of fire, wind, water, and earth to exploring everything
          from galaxies far away to the very building blocks of life itself.
        </p>
        <p>
          The aim of our museum is to create a space where everyone can
          experience the wonders of our discoveries and perhaps even ignite a
          lifelong passion to continue the exploration of the world around us.
        </p>
        <p>
          We believe science should not be confined to the textbook, but brought
          to live through exhibits. This is why we have over 1000 different
          exhibits on the many varied subjects of science to explore. Many of
          these exhibits are designed for you to interact with and play around
          to see science come to life (apart from the dinosaur exhibits - they
          only come to life at night when everyone's gone home).

              It is our pleasure to announce that Professor Sheila Widnall from
              the Massachusetts Institute of Technology will be visiting us.
            </p>
            <p>
              She will be delivering 3 lectures on the development of

            <p>
              On loan from the NEMO Science Museum in Amsterdam, the Energetica
              exhibition is coming to the Community Science Museum. It's a
              series of installations that allow visitors to experience the
              power of the elements as we harness them.
            </p>

              From solar energy powering lighting, to 'Wind Island' that shows
              how turbines are able to use and control wind to create power.

        <h4>For kids</h4>
        <p>
          Are you a young person looking to learn more about science? Come on
          down to our museum, there's plenty to see and do.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can learn about Newtonian physics from our bumper swing, or why
          not travel back in time and meet our resident Woolly Mammoth? Our
          exhibits are designed to be accessible for interested minds, so make
          sure you come ready to learn and explore.
        </p>
        <p>
          We also have the Young Stars club which meets once a week on a
          Saturday between 10:00 and 13:00 where you'll get to explore and
          experiment with our team of experts.
        </p>
        <p>
          During the school holidays we run special holiday clubs where you can
          join other children your age to go on a journey of discovery. Each
          holiday we pick a new theme to explore. To find out more about the
          holiday club and how you can join,
          <a href="visit-page.html">send us a message</a>.
