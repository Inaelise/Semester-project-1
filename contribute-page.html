              Donations are very welcome and are an important way we keep this
              museum open and accessible to the whole community.
            </p>
            <p>
              You can also support us by donating items of interest to the
              museum's collections.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you have some item or collection that you think others would
              enjoy, please let us know by contacting our Collections Department
              and they will be able to assist you.

          <p>Volunteer</p>

            <p>
              A number of people volunteer their time and effort to keep the
              displays in good order and ready for visitors to come and enjoy.
            </p>
            <p>
              Volunteering has its perks including getting to see behind the
              scenes of a working museum, access to staff-only lectures, and a
              monthly lunch where all staff and volunteers come together to
              discuss ideas for future exhibits and strategies for the museum.
            </p>
            <p>
              You can help volunteer in a number of different spheres. Please
              <a href="visit-page.html">contact us</a> if you'd like to find out
              more about how you can get involved.
